#  Tools for Reproducible Research

## Learning Objectives

- Generate reports for your analyses using RMarkdown
- Track changes as you work on files using a version control system called Git (GitHub Desktop tool)
- Collaborate effectively, and disseminate code & other documents using Github

## Preparation Requirements

### GitHub Desktop
Please [download and install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)
### Github account
Create an account for yourself on [GitHub](https://github.com/). Please be sure to select the free/academic account, as this option has more long-term flexibility.

### GitHub
* [Git on the command line](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Git-Github/#learning-objectives)
* The [Getting Started with GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/getting-started-with-github-desktop) is a great way to start exploring it's functionality, and learning more about what Git can do.
* GitHub also provides extensive support in the form of [guides](https://guides.github.com/) and [help](https://help.github.com/).
* GitHub [Glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) outlines the most commonly used GitHub/Git terminology.
* Software Carpentry's [Version Control with Git](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/)
* Data Carpentry for Biologist's lessons on [Version Control](https://datacarpentry.org/semester-biology/materials/version-control-R/)
* [HBC's adaptation](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Git-Github/#contents) of Software Carpentry's Git lessons
